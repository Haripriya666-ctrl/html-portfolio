<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi,my name is Haripriya.I would like to describe myself as a disciplined individual who is a late bloomer and an artist at heart.
  I believe in fulfilling my human potential that I am bestowed with.My educational journey so far has been enriching with a
   bachelor's
  in civil engineering.Right from school I  was an enthusiastic kid with a go getter attitude.
  The testimony to this is that I have served in the capacity of discipline captain at my school level introducing various
   reforms.At college level I was the student head of anti ragging commmittee and lead editor of the department.
   I have also served as the vice chair of the professional chapter of civil engineering which is the CEA ICI IGBC.</p> 

<p>Regarding my artistic endeavours I am a trained Bharatanatyam dancer with a professional experience of over 15 years in both 
  Kalakshetra and Thanjavur style.
  My experience  includes a basket of stage performances summing upto 30 of them and a distinction in certificate course from the
   prestigious 
  Potti Sreeramulu University.I have also cleared the first year diploma of the Sangeeta Visardha course and further pursuing 
  carnatic music under the able guidance of my gurus.My future goal is learn nattuvangam and establish a dance studio.
  Apart from this 
  I  have a flair for writing essays and poems as well.Being a design enthusiast I would like to become an entrepreneur
   in this arena.

  </p>

<p>I live by the pareto principle which says that 80% of the results come from the 20% of the efforts.My inspiration is the 
  greek mythological phoenix bird which rejunevates itself from the ashes for every 500-600 years giving itself a new life.
